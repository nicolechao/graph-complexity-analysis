# Graph Generation for Graph Structure Complexity Analysis

## Problem
Need to generate graphs with different types, structures for further structure complexity analysis.


## Approach
Using graph generator packages of networkx to generate graphs of different types and other existing popular graph like the karate_club_graph and save data to csv for future analysis.

## Deliverables
1. Graph genearion code in [Python notebook](https://github.com/nicolechao/graph-complexity-analysis/blob/master/Graph%20Generation/graph_generation.ipynb).
